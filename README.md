## Themes

The site includes 2 **built-in themes** that lets users toggle between:

- **Default Theme** — subtle blues and purples with floating orbs.
- **Synthwave Theme** — neon pinks and purples with retro triangle accents and a synthwave-style grid background.

The theme toggle is available in both desktop and mobile views.

### Default Theme:

### Synthwave Theme:

You can easily extend the design by modifying the `ThemeContext.jsx` file. Each theme entry includes:

- Gradient colors
- Text and button styles
- Accent visibility (e.g., floating dots or synthwave grid)
- SVG gradient stops

Simply add a new object to the `themes` map and hook it into the UI toggle.
